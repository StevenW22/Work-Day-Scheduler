# Work-Day-Scheduler

## We are creating a calendar application that allows a users to save events for each hour of the day.

- This projects motivation was to create a task scheduler with interactive coloring based on the time of day.
- Any task that is save by the button will be logged into the local storage and remain logged even after refreshing.
- With color cues the task shows what time of the day is past present and future.
- I feel the object of this challenge was the manipulate time and the user interface based on time.
